	<h1>Justin Timberlake</h1>

 
<p>During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his solo studio albums Justified (2002) and FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006); the former spawned hits "Cry Me a River" and "Rock Your Body", while the latter debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "SexyBack", "My Love", and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". With each album exceeding sales of seven million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers. From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time and Friends with Benefits. In 2013, he resumed his music career with his third album The 20/20 Experience (2013), which was preceded by lead single "Suit & Tie". The "second half" of The 20/20 Experience is tentatively scheduled for release in November. Timberlake's work has earned him six Grammy Awards and four Emmy Awards. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.</p>



<p>Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee to parents Lynn Harless (n√©e Bomar) and Randall Timberlake.[2] He grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington.[3] His paternal grandfather, Charles L. Timberlake, was a Baptist minister, and Timberlake was raised Baptist, though now considers himself more "spiritual than religious".[4] Timberlake's parents divorced when he was three; his mother remarried when he was five.[5] Timberlake's father has two children from his second marriage to Lisa Perry, Jonathan (born 1993) and Steven Robert (born August 14, 1998). His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 14, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album *NSYNC as "My Angel in Heaven."[6] At the age of 11, Timberlake appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country music songs as "Justin Randall."[3] In 1993 and 1994, he was a cast member in The Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and pop superstar Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actor Ryan Gosling.[7] In 1995, Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman,[8] that eventually became 'N Sync.</p>
