<h1>Justin Timberlake</h1>
<article class="grid_6 alpha">
<p>Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American actor, businessman, record producer and singer. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared in the television shows Star Search and The New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as the lead singer and youngest member of the boy band 'N Sync, whose launch was financed by Lou Pearlman.</p>
<p>During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his solo studio albums Justified (2002) and FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006); the former spawned hits "Cry Me a River" and "Rock Your Body", while the latter debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "SexyBack", "My Love", and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". With each album exceeding sales of seven million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers. From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time and Friends with Benefits. In 2013, he resumed his music career with his third album The 20/20 Experience (2013), which was preceded by lead single "Suit & Tie". The "second half" of The 20/20 Experience is tentatively scheduled for release in November. Timberlake's work has earned him six Grammy Awards and four Emmy Awards. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.</p>

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee to parents Lynn Harless (née Bomar) and Randall Timberlake.[2] He grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington.[3] His paternal grandfather, Charles L. Timberlake, was a Baptist minister, and Timberlake was raised Baptist, though now considers himself more "spiritual than religious".[4] Timberlake's parents divorced when he was three; his mother remarried when he was five.[5] Timberlake's father has two children from his second marriage to Lisa Perry, Jonathan (born 1993) and Steven Robert (born August 14, 1998). His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 14, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album *NSYNC as "My Angel in Heaven."[6] At the age of 11, Timberlake appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country music songs as "Justin Randall."[3] In 1993 and 1994, he was a cast member in The Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and pop superstar Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actor Ryan Gosling.[7] In 1995, Timberlake recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman,[8] that eventually became 'N Sync.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>
<article class="grid_3">
<h3>'N Sync</h3>
<p>The boy band 'N Sync formed in 1995, and began its career in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers.[9] In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their debut studio album *NSYNC, which sold 11 million copies and included hit single "Tearin' Up My Heart". Encouraged by similar developments with the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync engaged in a legal battle with Pearlman;[citation needed] they eventually signed with Jive Records. Their second album No Strings Attached (2000) became the fastest-selling album of all time[citation needed], with first-week sales of 2.4 million copies,[10] and produced a #1 single, "It's Gonna Be Me". 'N Sync's third album Celebrity (2001) was the second-fastest selling album of all time[citation needed]. Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went into hiatus in 2002. In its lifetime, 'N Sync was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards,[11] the Olympics,[12] and the Super Bowl,[13] as well as selling more than 50 million copies worldwide,[14] becoming the third-best selling boy band in history.</p>

<h3>Acting</h3>
<p>After the Super Bowl controversy, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several films, having starred in a few feature films earlier in his music career.[7] The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in Edison Force, filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006.[44] He also appeared in the films Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, Richard Kelly's Southland Tales, and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated film Shrek the Third, released on May 18, 2007.[45] He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John's song "This Train Don't Stop There Anymore".[46] Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the film version of the rock musical Rent, but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of Rent.</p>
<p>Around June 2007 Timberlake co-wrote, produced and provided vocals for the songs "Nite Runner" and "Falling Down" for Duran Duran's album Red Carpet Massacre, released on November 13, 2007. "Falling Down" had been released as a single in the UK on the previous day.[64] Also in 2007, Timberlake made an appearance on 50 Cent's third album, Curtis. Timberlake, along with Timbaland, is featured on a track called "Ayo Technology", which was the album's fourth single. Also, another possible collaboration was to occur with Lil Wayne for his album Tha Carter III with Nelly Furtado and Timbaland.[65] With the wrapping up of the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour of Australasia and the Middle East in November 2007, Timberlake resumed his film career. Projects underway early in 2008 were starring roles in Mike Myers' comedy The Love Guru (released June 20, 2008) and Mike Meredith's drama The Open Road (released August 28, 2009). In March 2008 it was announced that he was to be an executive producer in an American adaptation of the hit Peruvian comedy My Problem with Women for NBC.[66] On November 20, 2008, TV Guide reported that Timberlake’s next single, "Follow My Lead", which also featured vocals by Timberlake’s protégée, former YouTube star Esmée Denters, would be available for exclusive download through Myspace. All proceeds would go to Shriners Hospitals for Children, a charity dedicated to improving pediatric care for sick children.</p>

<h3>Return to Music</h3>
<p>Timberlake began work on his third studio album The 20/20 Experience in June 2012, with "no rules and/or end goal in mind".[90] He publicly announced his return to the music industry in January 2013,[91] releasing the album's lead single "Suit & Tie" featuring Jay-Z later that month. After four years not performing in concert, Timberlake appeared the night before the 2013 Super Bowl and performed during the "DirecTV Super Saturday Night", on February 2 in New Orleans.[92] On February 10, he performed "Suit & Tie" with sepia-toned lighting at the 55th Grammy Awards, with Jay-Z joining him from the audience. The 20/20 Experience was released on March 19[93] through RCA Records due to the disbandment of Jive Records.[94][95] The album debuted at number one on the charts by moving just over 980,000 copies.[96] On March 18, 2013, Timberlake announced that the "second half" of The 20/20 Experience will be released in November.</p>

<h2>Philanthropy</h2>
<p>Timberlake has been active in several charitable pursuits, initially through 'N Sync's "Challenge for the Children" aimed at a range of charities, and since 2001 through his "Justin Timberlake Foundation," which initially funded music education programs in schools, but now has a much broader agenda.[128] In October 2005, the Grammy Association presented Timberlake with an award for his humanitarian efforts in Tennessee, alongside writer/director Craig Brewer, also a Memphis native.[129]
<p>In November 2007 he donated A$100,000 from takings from his Australian tour to Wildlife Warriors founded by Steve Irwin.[130] On March 23, 2008, he donated $100,000 to the Memphis Rock 'n' Soul Museum and another $100,000 to the Memphis Music Foundation.[131]</p>
<p>On November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour announced that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a 6 handicap,[132] would become the host of the tour's Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake's agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament.[133] The activity was a success, and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake's contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the US during 2009, and worth over $US9 million.</p>
